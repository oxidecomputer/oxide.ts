# oxide.ts

This repo contains a TypeScript OpenAPI client generator and a copy of the
client it generates from [Oxide's OpenAPI
spec](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/omicron/blob/main/openapi/nexus.json).
The generator is built specifically for use with specs generated by
[Dropshot](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot). It has not been tested on
any other specs and is unlikely to handle them well.

|Package| Description|
|---|---|
| [`@oxide/openapi-gen-ts`](./oxide-openapi-gen-ts) | TypeScript OpenAPI client generator |
| [`@oxide/api`](./oxide-api) | The client generated for the Omicron commit specified in `OMICRON_VERSION` |

## Using the API client

See the [README](./oxide-api/README.md) for the `@oxide/api` package.

## Contributing

We prefer to keep the generator as simple as possible and narrowly scoped to our
use case, so we can't spend much time reviewing PRs intended to expand
functionality beyond what we need. If you like this generator and want to use it
on your own specs, we recommend forking.
