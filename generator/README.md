# TS OpenAPI client generator

You may have noticed there is no actual code here. We're using a very lightly patched version of [swagger-typescript-api](https://github.com/acacode/swagger-typescript-api). This will likely change in the future, looking more like [oxide.go](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/oxide.go), which includes a custom generator written in Go built on top of an existing OpenAPI spec parser library.
